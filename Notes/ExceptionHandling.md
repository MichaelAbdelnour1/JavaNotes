## üåü Introduction

Exceptions are events that occur during the execution of a program that disrupt the normal flow of instructions. They are used to handle errors and exceptional conditions in a controlled manner. Java provides a robust exception handling mechanism to catch and handle exceptions effectively.

## üå≥ Exception Hierarchy

All exception classes are subtypes of the `java.lang.Throwable` class. The exception hierarchy is as follows:

- Throwable
  - Error (unchecked)
  - Exception
    - RuntimeException (unchecked)
    - Other exceptions (checked)

## üé≠ Types of Exceptions

1. **Checked Exceptions**: Exceptional conditions that a well-written application should anticipate and recover from.
2. **Unchecked Exceptions**: Exceptional conditions that are internal to the application and usually indicate programming bugs.
3. **Errors**: Exceptional conditions that are external to the application and usually cannot be anticipated or recovered from.

## üîë Exception Handling Keywords

Java provides five keywords for handling exceptions:

1. `try`: Contains a block of code in which an exception can occur.
2. `catch`: Used to handle the exception.
3. `finally`: Used to execute important code such as closing resources.
4. `throw`: Used to throw an exception explicitly.
5. `throws`: Used to declare exceptions that a method might throw.

## üí° Basic Exception Handling

```java
try {
    // Code that may throw an exception
} catch (ExceptionType e) {
    // Exception handling code
}
```

## üé£ Multiple Catch Blocks

```java
try {
    // Code that may throw different types of exceptions
} catch (ExceptionType1 e) {
    // Exception handling code for ExceptionType1
} catch (ExceptionType2 e) {
    // Exception handling code for ExceptionType2
}
```

## üé¨ Finally Block

```java
try {
    // Code that may throw an exception
} catch (ExceptionType e) {
    // Exception handling code
} finally {
    // Code that always executes, regardless of exceptions
}
```

## üö® Throwing Exceptions

```java
throw new ExceptionType("Exception message");
```

## üìú Declaring Exceptions

```java
public void methodName() throws ExceptionType {
    // Method code
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Custom Exceptions

```java
public class CustomException extends Exception {
    public CustomException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
```

## üîí Try-with-Resources

```java
try (Resource resource = new Resource()) {
    // Code that uses the resource
} catch (ExceptionType e) {
    // Exception handling code
}
```

## üîó Exception Chaining

```java
try {
    // Code that may throw an exception
} catch (ExceptionType e) {
    throw new AnotherExceptionType("Exception message", e);
}
```

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

1. Don't swallow exceptions
2. Use specific exceptions
3. Log exceptions
4. Clean up resources
5. Avoid catching `Throwable`
6. Use custom exceptions when appropriate
7. Don't use exceptions for flow control
8. Throw exceptions early, catch them late

## üéì Conclusion

Exception handling is a fundamental aspect of writing robust and maintainable Java applications. By effectively utilizing Java's exception handling mechanisms, you can gracefully handle errors, separate error-handling code from regular code, and improve the overall reliability of your programs.

   git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/java-learning-claude-ai.git
   ```

4. **Choose a Topic**: 📚 Select a Java topic from the issues list or create a new one.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

- **Merge Conflicts**: 💥 If you encounter merge conflicts, resolve them locally and then push the changes.
- **Permission Issues**: 🔒 Ensure you're working on your fork and not trying to push directly to the original repository.
- **Outdated Fork**: 🔄 Regularly sync your fork with the upstream repository:
  ```
  git fetch upstream
  git checkout main
  git merge upstream/main
  ```

Remember, practice makes perfect! Don't be afraid to experiment in your own repositories to get comfortable with Git and GitHub. Happy coding! 💻✨

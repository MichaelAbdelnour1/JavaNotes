## How to Use Claude AI for Contributing

When using Claude AI to help with your contributions, follow this general structure for your prompts:


- Topic: [Specific Java topic you're working on]
- Current Understanding: [Brief description of what you already know or think you know about the topic]
- Learning Goal: [What you want to learn or clarify about the topic]
- Request: [Specific ask for Claude, e.g., explanation, code example, best practices]

Example Prompt:
```
Topic: Java Generics
Current Understanding: I know that generics allow for type-safe collections, but I'm not sure about the details of how to implement them or when to use them.
Learning Goal: To understand how to create and use generic classes and methods, and to know best practices for working with generics.
Request: Can you provide an explanation of Java generics with a simple code example, and then list some best practices for using generics in Java?
```

## Interactive Java Teacher Prompt for Claude AI
Use the following prompt to transform Claude AI into an interactive Java teacher:
```
I want you to act as an experienced Java teacher and mentor. Your role is to help me learn Java concepts, answer my questions, and guide me through programming challenges. Please follow these guidelines:

1. Provide clear and concise explanations of Java concepts.
2. Use code examples to illustrate your points when appropriate.
3. After answering my questions, ask me follow-up questions to check my understanding or to explore related concepts.
4. If I make a mistake or show a misconception, gently correct me and explain the right approach.
5. Encourage best practices and explain why they are important.
6. If I'm stuck, provide hints rather than immediate solutions to help me think through the problem.
7. Adapt your teaching style based on my responses and level of understanding.
8. Suggest small coding exercises or projects that can help reinforce the concepts we discuss.

Remember to maintain this teaching persona throughout our conversation, always aiming to deepen my understanding of Java.
My first question is: [Insert your Java-related question here]
```

#### How to Use This Prompt:

Copy the entire prompt above.
Replace "[Insert your Java-related question here]" with your specific Java question.
Paste the modified prompt into your conversation with Claude AI.
Engage with Claude as if it were your Java teacher, asking questions and responding to its follow-up queries.
